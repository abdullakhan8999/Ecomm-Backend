## Introduction

This backend server serves as the core of our e-commerce application, providing RESTful API endpoints for various features, including user management, product management, and order handling.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file and configure your environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret).
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Features

- User Authentication (Signup, Login, JWT)
- Product Management (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- User Management (Edit Roles, Delete Users)
- Order Management (Create, Read, Update Status, Delete)

## Deployment

Our backend is deployed on [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/) (or your chosen hosting platform). The production version can be accessed at [https://your-backend-url.com](https://ecomm-backend-5fix.onrender.com).

## Testing

We use testing frameworks such as Mocha and Chai for unit and integration testing. To run tests, use `npm test`.

## Security

- User data is securely stored and hashed using bcrypt.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication.
- Input validation and sanitization are performed to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
